                            Hi! I'm Marisa Kahn, an aspiring artist open to exploring all that graphic design has to offer. 
                            I fell in love with the world of graphic design through an elective class I took in eighth grade, 
                            and I have been pursuing it ever since. In the summer of 2021, I took a graphic design class that 
                            introduced me to basics in Adobe Photoshop. By taking digital media classes throughout high school, 
                            I further developed my knowledge and personal style within graphic design. Currently, I am attending 
                            San Francisco State University and studying Visual Communication Design and Psychology with hopes of 
                            growing my skills even further. My goal in life is to make a positive impact by helping others. I am 
                            very interested in creating design that is inclusive of and accessible to all, particularly in reference to UX design. 
                        </p>
