                            Born in San Francisco and raised in the South Bay, Marisa (she/her) is an aspiring artist open to exploring all that graphic design has to offer. She fell in love with the world of graphic design through an elective class that she took in eighth grade, and she has been pursuing it ever since. In the summer of 2021, Marisa took a graphic design class that introduced her to basics in Adobe Photoshop. By taking digital media classes throughout high school, she further developed my knowledge and personal style within graphic design. Currently, Marisa is a second-year student at San Francisco State University and is studying Visual Communication Design and Psychology with hopes of growing her skills even further. Marisa’s goal in life is to make a positive impact by helping others. She is very interested in creating design that is inclusive of and accessible to all, particularly in reference to UX design.

                            In her little amount of free time, Marisa enjoys trying new boba places (see this page for her recommendations!), cooking/baking and eating delicious foods, and going out with friends. She also likes to try new restaurants, but unfortunately eating out in San Francisco quickly becomes very expensive. Furthermore, some of her favorite activities include practicing artistic roller skating, ceramic wheel throwing (she finds this very therapeutic!), and listening to music while on a walk. Marisa’s taste in music is vast and includes pop, rock, alternative, hip hop, pop punk, and kpop genres. Her music preferences change depending on her mood, but currently she enjoys listening to music by All Time Low, Games We Play, Dean Lewis, (G)I-DLE, Stray Kids, and Eminem. In times when she needs to focus, she tends to listen to lofi music, instrumental soundtracks (especially those from anime), or piano covers.
